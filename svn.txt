Somebody can then run svn log -r 9238 to read about the exact changeset that fixed the bug, and run svn diff -c 9238 to see the patch itself. 

pwd = ~/my_calc_branch
svn merge ^/calc/trunk

Revert some previous change (--revision 392:391, or by an equivalent --change -392)
svn merge ^/calc/trunk . -c-392

Resurrect a file with history
:> svn copy ^/calc/trunk/src/real.c@399 ./real.c
Without history:
:> svn cat ^/calc/trunk/src/real.c@399 > ./real.c
:> svn add real.c
Purely remotely:
:> svn copy ^/calc/trunk/src/real.c@399 ^/calc/trunk/src/real.c -m "Resurrect real.c from revision 399."

To move local changes to a new branch

:> svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/newbranch \
           -m "Create branch 'newbranch'."
:> svn switch ^/calc/branches/newbranch
